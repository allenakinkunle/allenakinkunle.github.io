<h2>About</h2>

I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in London, United Kingdom. I work within EY's Emerging Technologies team where I use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to build intelligent data products.

Before joining EY, I was a software developer building web and cross-platform mobile applications. I worked with startups in Lagos and London.

I hold a Masters degree in Data Science from Lancaster University and a BSc in Information Technology & Business Information Systems from Middlesex University.
