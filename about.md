<h2>About</h2>

I am a Data Scientist based in London, United Kingdom. I currently work within [EY UK's](http://www.ey.com/uk/en/home) Data & Analytics team (Transaction Advisory Services service line) where I consult for companies across different industry verticals, using advanced data science techniques to solve business problems.

Before joining EY, I was a software developer building web and cross-platform mobile applications. I worked with startups in Lagos and London.

I hold a Master degree in Data Science from Lancaster University and a BSc in Information Technology & Business Information Systems from Middlesex University.
